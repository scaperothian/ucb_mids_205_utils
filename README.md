# MIDS DATASCI205 Utilities

## Starting and stoping containers and cleaning up the environment

Runs commands to start up the containers in the background using tmux.  that way, if I lost connectivity for some reason, the session would persist beyond my shell on my local machine.<br>

./start-jupyter.sh - starts the containers and the tmux sessions<br>
./stop-jupyter.sh  - stops the containers and kills the tmux sessions.<br>
